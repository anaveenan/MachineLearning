    "Write a program in Python (or in Spark; this part is optional) to implement the ID3 decision tree algorithm. You should build a tree to predict PlayTennis, based on the other attributes (but, do not use the Day attribute in your tree.).

For example, here is the tennis dataset. The first line will contain the names of the fields:\n",
