    "## How do you merge  two sorted  lists/arrays of records of the form [key, value]? Where is this  used in Hadoop MapReduce?\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Assuming the lists are already sorted, compare the first element from each list and take the lesser element and add to a new sortedlist.  Then compare the larger of first elements with the next in the other, take the smaller and add to the sorted list. Repeat this process until both original lists have been completely parsed.  Here is some code to demonstrate further._\n",

    "\n",
    "### _A combiner is used between map class and reducer class to reduce the data transfer between mapper and reducer as a sort of \"pre reducer.\"  An example of where a combiner should be used (other than always) is with the Wordcount problem with a large dictionary.  Because there could be a large number of records coming from each mapper, the reducer could get overtaxed, which would lead to either a crash or a large amount of time to complete.  The combiner will act as an \"in-mapper reducer\" and consolidate the output from the mapper by combining similar keys.  This way, fewer records are passed to the reducer.  This speeds up the process and reduces the risk of system crash._\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Hadoop shuffle?\n",
    "### _The Hadoop shuffle is the process of moving key-value pairs from the a mapper to the reducer.  As data is being moved from mapper to reducer, it is being sorted to simplify the reducer's processing.  In the example of word count, a word appearing more than one time in the mapper's output to the reducer will be sorted together, so the reducer doesn't have to parse the entire input in order to aggregate._"
